By using drift draft students will no longer feel pressured to join neither a dictating organization nor an expensive institute in order to feel confident to receive a job once graduated. I have a theory (If you want a great job, go to college. If you want to be rich, donâ€™t.) Drift draft eliminates the anxiety of wondering if your sacrifice leaving school was a wise decision. Not everyone is fortunate to have roommates that are on the same page as them but the persons you may need could in fact be on campus looking for you. If youâ€™re searching for singles, friendship, tutoring, partnership, internships, homework, drift draft is an inevitable stop for a college student to make. The innovation of using drift draft is only college students with an online campus email may register. That includes junior colleges, double A, Triple a, etc. Companies that are looking to post internships and/or jobs for students may also register with their companies email. Once registered, companies can post help wanted positions by answering the questions listed such as the position, location, hours, etc. on our job board. All registered students will be notified how many jobs are listed on the site and have full access to apply for the job by uploading a resume if requested by employer. Students have their own section to add any openings for employment or new business ventures. Students will not be able to post jobs on the job board. Employers may keep the students updated on jobs or anything job related that the employer feels is important for the student bodies to know by using the updated section that will be posted to the â€œWhatâ€™s newâ€ section. Students can upload pictures, videos, and music using drift draft.  Students can help each other on take home quizzes and help one another study for a quiz using the â€œquizâ€ link. Students also have access to discuss a variety of subject amongst their friends using the multi-blog link provided. Drift draft has a hand full of activities in order to give you a reason to remain in college or gives you a reason to leave if an opportunity approaches. I have several of campus emails that assure all students will have full access to using drift draft. My goal is to stop the madness and suicide from our youth and finally go through college stress free. Drift draft is a win-win for college students regardless of their needs and that includes no more flyers to read or no more using of the career center. Drift draft does it all and more. I sure hope you see my vision and help me to reach my goal.</p>",,,,,//,//,//,//

<p>Facebook was founded by <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg"" title=""Mark Zuckerberg"">Mark Zuckerberg</a> in February 2004, initially as an exclusive network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz"" title=""Dustin Moskovitz"">Dustin Moskovitz</a>, <a href=""/person/chris-hughes"" title=""Chris Hughes"" rel=""nofollow"">Chris Hughes</a>, and <a href=""/person/eduardo-saverin"" title=""Eduardo Saverin"" rel=""nofollow"">Eduardo Saverin</a> to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks. </p>

<p>The original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg&#8217;s high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.</p>

<p>With this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to <a href=""/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto"" title=""Palo Alto"" rel=""nofollow"">Palo Alto</a> for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of <a href=""/company/napster"" title=""Napster"" rel=""nofollow"">Napster</a>, <a href=""/person/sean-parker"" title=""Sean Parker"" rel=""nofollow"">Sean Parker</a>. Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg&#8217;s apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, <a href=""/person/peter-thiel"" title=""Peter Thiel"" rel=""nofollow"">Peter Thiel</a>, cofounder of <a href=""/company/paypal"" title=""PayPal"" rel=""nofollow"">PayPal</a> and managing partner of <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund"" title=""The Founders Fund"">The Founders Fund</a>. Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook. </p>

<p>With millions more users, <a href=""/company/friendster"" title=""Friendster"" rel=""nofollow"">Friendster</a> <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/"" title=""attempted"">attempted</a> to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners"" title=""Accel Partners"">Accel Partners</a>, at a valuation of <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/"" title=""around $100 million"">around $100 million</a>. Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock"" title=""Greylock Partners"">Greylock Partners</a> and <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners"" title=""Meritech Capital"">Meritech Capital</a>, as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/"" title=""opened"">opened</a> up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/"" title=""opened"">opened</a> to anyone with an email address. </p>

<p>In the summer of 2006, <a href=""/company/yahoo"" title=""Yahoo"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo</a> <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/"" title=""attempted to acquire"">attempted to acquire</a> the company for $1 billion dollars. <a href=""http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook"" title=""Reports"" rel=""nofollow"">Reports</a> actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo&#8217;s stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/"" title=""offered"">offered</a> $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the &#8220;kid&#8221; who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; <a href=""/company/viacom"" title=""Viacom"" rel=""nofollow"">Viacom</a> had previously <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/"" title=""unsuccessfully"">unsuccessfully</a> attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006. </p>

<p>Not long after, in October 2007, <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/"" title=""Microsoft invested"">Microsoft invested</a> $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/"" title=""5th most valuable US Internet company"">5th most valuable US Internet company</a>, yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft&#8217;s decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.</p>

<p>Facebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/"" title=""$1.5 billion round"">$1.5 billion round</a>, valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/"" title=""announced"">announced</a> that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering.

<p>One sour note for Facebook has been the <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/"" title=""controversy"">controversy</a> with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook.

<p>Notwithstanding this lingering controversy, Facebook&#8217;s growth has been staggering.

Facebook also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day.

<pre><code>* Ask your friends to get contact numbers for cook/maid etc, which they themselves wonï¿½t be having.
* Hunt for news paper to get some contact number, which again is not fruitful.
* Do all chores on your own. Sadly we are generally forced to opt for option 3.
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the fourth lucrative option:</p>

<pre><code>* 1, Login to www.indiaonapage.com , go to your city page and get all the information you want.
</code></pre>

<p>Think of another scenario: It is Friday evening; you are back from hard work at office, thinking about how to spend the precious weekend. Alas! You have no clue of what to do. Again you have 3 options:</p>

<pre><code>* Call Reeta, Ganesh , Amit or Sheeta to check if they are free.
* Hunt newspaper to see if you get any idea to spend weekend.
* Stick to your favorite time pass (sleeping).

  Here is the fourth lucrative option:

* 1, Login to www.indiaonapage.com, go to your city page and get all the information you want about movies, events etc.
</code></pre>

<p>These are not fictitious scenarios but real time scenarios. Most of us really face such scenarios in our life. ï¿½Necessity is mother of inventionï¿½, so is IndiaOnAPage. It is created for all city/town dwellers to get all kind of information on there city on click of a button.

<p>Surging numbers of Chinese applicants to U.S. colleges have left admission offices searching for better ways to separate the “great” from the “merely good“ (and from the “too good to be true”). We solve this by conducting unscripted and interactive interviews of applicants, and then provide admission officers with a link to the videotaped interviews in an easy-to-process format.</p>

<p>Since our announcement in August that Dr. Jerry Lucido of USC is joining InitialView as a senior advisor, we have made significant progress engaging with prominent colleges and boarding schools. We now have three top schools who will be recommending our interviews to their applicants this year: Georgia Tech, UMass Amherst, and NC State, all of which handled hundreds of applications from China last year. A selection of boarding schools will also be using our interviews in evaluating China-based applicants.  </p>",,,,,//,//,//,//

InternMatch,http://www.crunchbase.com/company/internmatch,"<p>InternMatch is an online platform that connects students with internships.  InternMatch focuses on helping start-up companies, small businesses, and non-profit organizations, to find and connect with highly skilled interns.  </p>

<p>Founded in 2009 by Andrew Maguire, InternMatch began as a Washington only platform.  In September of 2010 InternMatch expanded their services to the west coast. Noting that only a very narrow set of large employers had the money, brand, and recruiting know-how to effectively bring on board capable interns, InternMatch focuses on small and mid-size companies. This means InternMatch acts as a discovery tool for internship seekers who traditionally have been funneled into a small set of highly competitive internship opportunities. </p>

<p>To achieve this goal InternMatch claims to focus on three areas:
First, InternMatch is looking to make the internship search and posting process incredibly simple. On the InternMatch platform both internship seekers and employers can search for a match, receive skill and location based matching recommendations, and access tools to manage the application process. Students can also search and apply to opportunities without registering.  </p>

<p>Second, InternMatch has built and continues to construct an evolving library of resources and tools. Students can access tools for resume creation, internship preparation, and more. Organizations can access resources that help with intern management, program development and advice on compensation. </p>

<p>Third, InternMatch has built the infrastructure to help interested students connect with socially responsible positions â€“ especially at nonprofit organizations. Rather than volunteer, students recognize the value in experiential learning that combines positive social impact with career building which is a key tenet for InternMatch.</p>",,,,,//,//,//,//

<p>The site officially launched in public beta on September 1, 2008. It is found at http://www.lymabean.com.</p>

These placements are sold for the local schoolâ€™s market only, so revenue reaches significant levels when aggregated with the 1,000+ other U.S. college markets where Lymabean is available.</p>",,,,,//,//,//,//

<p>Many retailers are willing to sell their products for lower-than-retail prices, but on one condition: they have to sell a lot of them. Unfortunately, most retailers don&#8217;t know how to guarantee that they&#8217;ll find enough buyers. Here&#8217;s where we come in.</p>

<p>At NumbersPay.com, we display a wide array of products from retailers at abnormally low prices. When you sign up as a NumbersPay user, you can pledge to purchase any of the products we show. For the deals to actually go through, we need a minimum number of pledges before the deal expires. When this happens, the retailers are happy, the deal is official and your order ships at the end of the time limit. If the minimum number of pledges isn&#8217;t reached by the time limit, the deal is cancelled and you aren&#8217;t charged a thing.</p>

<p>But this is where it gets interesting. For many items, as the number of pledges grows we can continue to lower the prices they&#8217;re offered at. Once the number of users pledging to buy an item reaches a bonus marker, its price drops by a certain percentage. Many of the items have multiple bonus deals, so by letting your friends know about NumbersPay and encouraging them to join, you can increase your chances of getting better and better deals. It boils down to this: the more people buying an item, the less it will cost. And we&#8217;ve integrated the site with online social networks to make sharing easier.</p>

<p>Getting started is simple. Subscribe to our newsletter and follow us on Facebook or Twitter to start receiving notifications about our latest deals.

PlayerMania.com,http://www.crunchbase.com/company/playermania-com,"<p>PlayerMania.com brings the best amateur players together in order to network, find leagues and show sports history. </p>

<p>PlayerMania.com can be described as a combination of Myspace, Facebook and ESPN. It enables athletes to set up a sports profile which displays information about all the sports they play and where they played them. The site even goes as far as letting them link up to current and past high school and college teams by the season that they played. David Wolf, a former division 3 basketball player and founder of PlayerMania.com, believes that pro&#8217;s shouldn&#8217;t be the only ones getting all the recognition. </p>

<p>You donâ€™t have to be a pro to be a great player. &#8220;There are so many great players out there not making millions of dollars, and it&#8217;s time to bring them together&#8221;, Wolf said. &#8220;We are looking for players who are playing, have played or plan on playing in high school and college.&#8221; PlayerMania.com is dedicated to the people out there that play for the love of the game.</p>

<p>Wolf came up with the idea of the site after finishing college and finding it hard to find competitive leagues and great players. â€œI would go to the local gym and maybe half of the guys could play; thatâ€™s not fun when youâ€™re used to playing against some really great players.&#8221; &#8220;I also hated how hard it was to find leagues in my area. I would have to go to every park district&#8217;s web site and dig through all the programs just to find the basketball league&#8221;, Wolf added. The site solves these issues with its advanced player search and league search feature.</p>

<p>The site, which is entirely free, also allows players to write their own sports articles. If you ever wanted to be a sports writer, this is your chance. A really cool feature on the site is that it allows players to rate their friends at various categories of the sports they play. This makes it possible to do a search for a specific player based on rating. This feature works great if, for example, you are starting a recreational basketball team and need a center that can rebound and block shots. Now you can just search for centers in your area with high ratings in rebounds and blocks. Every member also gets a virtual trading card with their uploaded photo that flips 360 degrees. If youâ€™re a golfer, you can add your scores and the site will figure out your handicap and rank.</p>

<p>Wolf says that there are a lot more features in the works. He aims to make this site the center of every playerâ€™s life.</p>",,,,,//,//,//,//

SubItUp,http://www.crunchbase.com/company/subitup,"<p>SubItUp is a Manchester, NH based startup that is revolutionizing how employee scheduling is accomplished. Starting with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), SubItUp has implemented a scheduling tool that allows users to create a single shift, or automatically generate shifts weeks in advance. These options open time for managers to focus on more efficient operations instead of scheduling.</p>

<p>Communication Simplified
The program also acts as a communication tool, notifying employees of schedule updates instantly via text message, email or both. The messaging tools allow managers to schedule their messages for later dates or send immediately, making it perfect for communicating meetings or special events.</p>

<p>Managers Lives Made Easy
On the operations side, SubItUp also comes with a labor cost reporting tool which will allow managers to predict labor requirements based on past trends. It is also very useful in helping managers meet labor budgets set by the company. With the employee history tool, managers can also pick up on employee trends, allowing them to offer more targeted shifts for employees that seem to request the same shifts off each month.</p>

<p>Happy Employees = Happy Customers
On the employee side of scheduling, SubItUp makes swapping, adding and dropping shifts easier than ever. Instant notifications are sent from SubItUp to employees when an employee requests a swap or drop of shits. All employee activities are held in moderation, meaning managers have the ability to approve or deny all add, drop and swap requests.</p>

<p>A cost and time effective alternative to manual scheduling, SubItUp can make a difference for managers in almost every shift-based industry.</p>

<p>About SubItUp Inc.</p>

<p>SubItUp is a web based employee scheduling tool that can execute tasks as simple as creating a single shift on one day, to automatically generating multiple shifts for weeks. The program is capable of helping managers control labor costs to meet budgets and labor laws. It also keeps management connected to employees with department-wide email and text applications, messaging tools, and moderated shift change requests. SubItUp helps pick up on employee schedule trends and activities so that managers can maximize scheduling efficiency across every department within any shift-based business.</p>",,,,,//,//,//,//

Textbook Revolt,http://www.crunchbase.com/company/textbook-revolt,"<p>Textbook Revolt aims to revolutionize the college textbook market by empowering students to save money by creating a trusted network for textbook exchanges.</p>

<p>The cost of college textbooks has doubled the rate of inflation over the past 20 years.  Students spend over $4.9 billion on college textbooks each year with few alternatives to help them save money.  The average yearly cost of textbooks has increased from $898 in 2005 to over $1,000 in 2006.  Every year television reports and newspaper columns have stories about the rising prices of textbooks and the lack of options available for the students, but there still has been very little progress in this industry.</p>

<p>Textbook Revolt began addressing the problem of high priced textbooks by experimenting with a completely free college textbook exchange named Socialbib.  The site has received many accolades from students who were previously dissatisfied with the options available to them.  As a result, students from over 1,300 schools nationwide joined Socialbib and posted over $1,000,000 in college textbooks.</p>

<p>Research proves that although online retailers such as Ebay and Amazon have added competition they have not significantly changed the landscape of the textbook industry.  Demand is rapidly increasing as the overall cost of education continues to rise.  It is evident that this problem will continue to exist as long as students are not presented with compelling alternatives.  The knowledge gained though Socialbib gives Textbook Revolt a competitive advantage to be the first service of its kind to market.  The demand from students when combined with the business opportunities create a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; for Textbook Revolt.</p>",,,,,//,//,//,//
